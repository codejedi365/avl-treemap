## Purpose

## Rationale

<!-- How did you come to this conclusion as the solution? What was your reasoning? What were you trying to do? -->

## How did you test?

<!-- Where are your unit tests? How did you verify this solution? -->

## How to Verify

<!-- List of steps to validate your PR -->

<!-- I prefer Test Driven Development (TDD) or BDD so ideally you have added to the unit test suite to prove it was a problem before and now the problem is solved -->

<!-- EXAMPLE Steps
1. Check out this branch
2. Run `npm install`
3. Revert library fix: `git checkout master -- path/to/file(s)`
4. Run `npm test`. # of tests added will fail without this fix
5. Review & validate the test cases written to understand what scenarios are fixed.
6. Reset the library to this branch. `git checkout HEAD -- path/to/file(s)
7. Run `npm test` again. All tests will pass verifying there was no regression and the buggy scenarios were fixed.
